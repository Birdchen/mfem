Version 1.2, released on Apr 08, 2011
=====================================

- New MPI parallel version of the library based on the ParCSR parallel matrix
  format from hypre and the metis graph partitioning library. This version
  supports parallel local refinement and parallel curved meshes, as well as
  several solvers from hypre.

- Added a new example code describing an electromagnetic diffusion problem
  discretized with lowest order Nedelec finite elements (Example 3).

- Added parallel versions of all examples codes (files ex1p.cpp, ex2p.cpp and
  ex3p.cpp) based on hypre's BoomerAMG and AMS preconditioners.

- Added support for saving and reading linear and curved quadratic meshes in VTK
  format. The format is automatically recognized when opening a mesh file, and
  the boundary is reconstructed based on the actual domain boundary.

- The 'data' directory now contains a collection of various mesh files in the
  MFEM and VTK formats, including curved meshes and the mesh files that were
  previously in the 'examples' directory.

- Updated the default integration rule order for most of the linear form
  integrators.

- Added support for cubic hex elements.

- Bugfixes in the face orientation of 3D RT0 elements and in the VectorFEDomain
  linear form integrator.

- Various small fixes and styling updates.


Version 1.1, released on Sep 13, 2010
=====================================

- New MFEM mesh v1.0 format with uniform structure for any dimension and support
  for curved meshes including in 3D.  Class Mesh will recognize and read the new
  format (in addition to all previously used formats) and Mesh::Print uses the
  new format by default. The old print function was renamed to Mesh::PrintXG.

- Added an example code for linear elasticity with (high-order) vector finite
  elements (Example 2).

- Added Mesh::PrintVTK and GridFunction::SaveVTK methods for output in VTK
  format.

- Implemented GeometryRefiner::Refine for CUBE and TETRAHEDRON geometries. This
  allows for saving curved meshes in the VTK format.

- Added SConstruct file for mfem/examples.

- Various small fixes and styling updates.


Version 1.0, released on Jul 21, 2010
=====================================

- Uploaded to http://mfem.googlecode.com.

- Initial release.
