Version 1.1, released on Sep 13, 2010
=====================================

- New MFEM mesh v1.0 format with uniform structure for any dimension and support
  for curved meshes including in 3D.  Class Mesh will recognize and read the new
  format (in addition to all previously used formats) and Mesh::Print uses the
  new format by default. The old print function was renamed to Mesh::PrintXG.

- Added an example code for linear elasticity with (high-order) vector finite
  elements (Example 2).

- Added Mesh::PrintVTK and GridFunction::SaveVTK methods for output in VTK
  format.

- Implemented GeometryRefiner::Refine for CUBE and TETRAHEDRON geometries. This
  allows for saving curved meshes in the VTK format.

- Added SConstruct file for mfem/examples.

- Various small fixes and styling updates.
