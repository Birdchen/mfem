This directory contains Doxygen configuration files for building HTML
documentation of the MFEM sources (including the example codes).

If not already available, Doxygen can be downloaded from

   http://www.doxygen.org

We recommend using version 1.8 or later.

To build the documentation, simply type "make" in the doc/ directory. This will
create the file CodeDocumentation.html, which can be viewed in any web browser.
To clean the (relatively large) CodeDocumentation/ directory, type "make clean".

Alternatively, the (pre-build) documentation can be browsed directly online at

   http://doxygen.mfem.googlecode.com/hg/html/index.html
