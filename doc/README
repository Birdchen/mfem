This directory contains the Doxygen configuration files for building the HTML
documentation of the MFEM sources (including the example codes).

If not already available, Doxygen can be downloaded from

   http://www.doxygen.org

We recommend using version 1.8 or later.

The code documentation can be build simply by typing "make" in the doc/
directory, which will create the file CodeDocumentation.html. To clean the
(relatively large) build type "make clean".

Alternatively, the (pre-build) documentation can also be browsed online at

   http://doxygen.mfem.googlecode.com/hg/html/index.html
