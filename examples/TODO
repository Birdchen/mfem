Planned MFEM Example Codes:
===========================

ex1 - Linear FEM for Poisson in 2D/3D. [DONE]
ex1p- Parallel version of ex1 using BoomerAMG. [DONE]

ex2 - Elasticity with higher-order and non-conforming (Crouzeix-Raviart, etc.)
      elements in 2D/3D. Assume that the mesh has two materials and three
      boundary attributes (Dirichlet, Neumann-down and Neumann-zero). Cantilever
      beam test problems (with beam meshes split in two materials).
      [DONE] - without the non-conforming discretizations which actually leads
               to singular matrices with the standard bilinear form (they are OK
               for the reformulated pure Dirichlet form which doesn't have
               rotations in its local nullspace).
ex2p- Parallel version of ex2 using BoomerAMG. [DONE]

ex3 - Electromagnetic diffusion showcasing Nedelec elements.
ex3p- Parallel version of ex3 using AMS.

ex4 - Mixed finite elements showcasing Raviart-Thomas elements in 2D/3D.

ex5 - Geometric Multigrid for Poisson in 2D/3D showcasing local refinement and
      the construction of interpolation operators. Requires bringing the MG code
      back into MFEM.

ex6 - Mesh smoothing showcasing curved meshes.
      [DONE]
