Planned MFEM Example Codes:
===========================

ex1 - Linear FEM for Poisson in 2D/3D. [DONE]

ex2 - Elasticity with higher-order and non-conforming (Crouzeix-Raviart, etc.)
      elements in 2D/3D. Assume that the mesh has two materials and three
      boundary attributes (Dirichlet, Neumann-down and Neumann-zero). Cantilever
      beam test problems (with beam meshes split in two materials).

ex3 - Mixed finite elements showcasing Raviart-Thomas elements in 2D/3D.

ex4 - Geometric Multigrid for Poisson in 2D/3D showcasing local refinement and
      the construction of interpolation operators. Requires bringing the MG code
      back into MFEM.

ex5 - Magnetostatics in 3D with GMG or AMS showcasing Nedelec elements. If it
      doesn't work, try electromagnetic diffusion (with time stepping) .

ex6 - Mesh smoothing showcasing curved meshes. [DONE]
