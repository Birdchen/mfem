This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM features based on the PETSc package.

To build these examples, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_PETSC = YES", see the top-level INSTALL file for details (version
3.8 or higher of the PETSC dev branch is required).

We recommend comparing the original example codes with the corresponding files
in the current directory.
