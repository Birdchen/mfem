This directory contains a collection of electromagnetic miniapps based on MFEM.

Compared to the example codes in the examples/ directory, the miniapps are more
complex, demonstrating more advanced usage of the library. They are intended to
be more representative of MFEM-based application codes. We recommend that new
users start with the example codes before moving to the miniapps.

The current electromagnetic miniapps are:
