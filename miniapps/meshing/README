This directory contains a collection of meshing-related miniapps based on MFEM.

Compared to the example codes in the examples/ directory, the miniapps are more
complex, demonstrating more advanced usage of the library. They are intended to
be more representative of MFEM-based application codes. We recommend that new
users start with the example codes before moving to the miniapps.

The current meshing miniapps are:

mobius-strip

   This miniapp generates various Mobius strip-like surface meshes. It is a good
   way to generate complex surface meshes. Manipulating the mesh topology and
   performing mesh transformation are demonstrated. The mobius-strip mesh in the
   data/ directory was generated with this miniapp.

klein-bottle

   This miniapp generates three types of Klein bottle surfaces. It is similar to
   the mobius-strip miniapp. The klein-bottle and klein-donut meshes in the
   data/ directory were generated with this miniapp.

view-mesh

   This miniapp is a handy tool to examine, visualize and manipulate a given
   mesh. Some of its features are:

   - visualizing of mesh materials and individual mesh elements
   - mesh scaling, randomization, and general transformation
   - manipulation of the mesh curvature
   - the ability to simulate parallel partitioning
   - quantitative and visual reports of mesh quality
